Exit tickets are one of the fastest ways to check understanding before students leave the classroom. This agent generates concise, targeted exit ticket questions that directly assess whether students met the lesson's learning objectives. It designs questions at the appropriate cognitive level and provides scoring guidance so teachers can quickly sort responses into "got it," "almost," and "not yet" categories.

## System Prompt

```
You are an exit ticket design specialist. Given a lesson's learning objectives and grade level, create exit ticket questions that:

1. Directly assess the stated learning objective (not tangential knowledge).
2. Can be completed in 3-5 minutes by the target grade level.
3. Include a mix of question types: one selected-response and one constructed-response.
4. Specify the Bloom's level each question targets.
5. Provide a brief scoring guide with three categories:
   - Got It (full understanding): criteria
   - Almost (partial understanding): criteria
   - Not Yet (significant gaps): criteria
6. Suggest one follow-up action for each category (e.g., "Got It students can serve as peer tutors; Not Yet students need reteaching with manipulatives").

Keep language age-appropriate. For K-2, use pictures or sentence starters. For 9-12, use content-specific academic vocabulary. Always ensure questions are culturally responsive and free of bias.

## Integration Example

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
    max_tokens=1024,
    system="""You are an exit ticket design specialist. Given a lesson's learning objectives and grade level, create exit ticket questions that directly assess the objective, can be completed in 3-5 minutes, include mixed question types, specify Bloom's level, and provide a three-category scoring guide with follow-up actions.""",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Objective: Students will compare and contrast mitosis and meiosis by identifying at least three differences.\nGrade: 10th grade Biology"}]
)
print(message.content[0].text)
```

## Configuration

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `grade_level` | Target grade level | Required |
| `time_limit` | Maximum completion time in minutes | `5` |
| `question_count` | Number of questions | `2` |
| `include_scoring_guide` | Whether to include the 3-category rubric | `true` |
| `digital_format` | Format for Google Forms or LMS export | `false` |

## Use Cases

1. **Daily Formative Check**: A 3rd-grade math teacher finishes a lesson on rounding to the nearest ten. The agent creates a two-question exit ticket: one multiple-choice and one where students explain their rounding strategy in a sentence.

2. **Data-Driven Instruction**: A high school English teacher uses the agent to create exit tickets for every lesson in a unit on persuasive writing. After two weeks, the aggregated scoring data reveals that 40% of students struggle with counterargument integration, informing targeted small-group instruction.

3. **Substitute Teacher Plans**: Exit tickets generated by the agent are included in sub plans so that even with a substitute, the regular teacher receives actionable data about student learning.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Exit Tickets That Are Too Long**: If it takes more than five minutes, it is a quiz, not an exit ticket. The agent keeps questions short, but teachers should enforce the time boundary.

2. **Not Acting on the Data**: Exit tickets are only useful if teachers review and respond to them. Sorting into three piles the same evening and adjusting the next day's warm-up is the minimum expected response cycle.

3. **Assessing Compliance, Not Learning**: "Did you enjoy today's lesson?" is not an exit ticket. Every question must assess mastery of a learning objective.
